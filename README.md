# Simon Says Game
Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive memory game where players replicate a sequence of colors generated by the game. Each level progressively adds a new color to the sequence, challenging the player's memory and reaction speed. This project serves as a classic example of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive, browser-based applications.

# Features
Responsive Layout: The game adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring smooth play on both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic Game Levels: Each correct player response increases the game level, making the sequence progressively longer.

Visual Feedback: Flash effects and background color changes provide feedback on user actions and game events (correct sequences, game over).

High Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the highest score achieved during the session, displayed prominently for motivation.

# Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure of the game interface.

CSS: Styles the buttons and layout, with media queries for responsive design.

JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including sequence generation, user input handling, level progression, and high score tracking.

# Components
HTML Structure:
Title and Instructions (h1 and h2 tags) guide players on how to start and play the game.
button-container: A flexbox layout that holds the four colored buttons (red, yellow, green, blue).

CSS Styling:
.btn classes style each colored button with distinct colors and flashing effects.
Media queries adjust button size and text for better accessibility on smaller screens.

JavaScript Logic:
gameSeq and userSeq arrays track the game's and user's color sequences.
LevelUp function adds a new color to the sequence at each level.
checkAns function compares the playerâ€™s input to the generated sequence, determining if the player advances or if the game ends.
Event listeners handle user input, enabling interaction through mouse clicks or keyboard presses.

# How to Play

Follow the Sequence: Watch the color pattern displayed by the game, then click the buttons in the same order.

Level Up: Successfully repeat the pattern to advance to the next level.
